It comes down to quality.  Kids’ skin is young and delicate so products must work with their quality of skin.  For example, the glue we use contains no latex and is used for medical prosthetic applications as well as in the arts and entertainment industry, the glitter is cosmetic grade and it can be used around the eye as eye make up.  All our products comply with EU (and the USA) health and safety regulations.  </p>\n<p>The best reason of all, the quality of the product also means the end result is so much more vibrant, it makes you want to dance, float and feel brightly magical.</p>',61,1,NULL),(7,2,'',0,0,1,'Christmas is now most definitely here....','christmas-is-now-most-definitely-here','So now its exactly 2 weekends to go before the big climax..

Also known as “mendhi” , it is a mark of prosperity, fortune and happiness and is used to celebrate weddings and births and at festivals of Teej, Diwali and Id. In modern times, celebraties such as Madonna, Sting and his wife Trudie Styler, Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), Gwen Stefani have brought henna into vogue.

From here it spread to South Asia. Over the centures it has developed to become an intricate art form rich in symbolism. Also known as “mendhi” , it is a mark of prosperity, fortune and happiness and is used to celebrate weddings and births and at festivals of Teej, Diwali and Id.<br> <br>In modern times, celebraties such as Madonna, Sting and his wife Trudie Styler, Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), Gwen Stefani have brought henna into vogue.<br> <br>Henna or “lawsonia inermis” is a shrub that can grow up to 7 m high at its tallest with a greyish brown bark. Its wood is close grained and hard with almond shaped leaves, brown pea-sized seeds spherical in shape and sweet scented creamy-white flowers.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"/static/media/uploads/henna%20cafe%20marrakech.jpg\" width=\"200\">       The whole henna shrub is used:</p>\n<p>• Wood to make tool handles and tent pegs<br>• Leaves for skin and hair dye and in traditional medicine<br>• Seeds and flowers for traditional medicine, oil and perfumery<br> <br>For body art, the henna paste is made up of henna powder, lemon juice, sugar, tea essential oils like lavender, cajeput and tee tree, rose and sandalwood. The paste is then coned and the design is applied in the same way as caked are iced!</p>\n<p>The final colour stain achieved is unique to each individual depending on their body heat! The warmer you are the darker your stain.</p>\n<h2>Henna and Asian Brides</h2>\n<p>Henna is used to dye hands and feet and it is the crowning glory of the traditional Asian bride as the images reflect but it has some disadvantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To achieve the rich colours the paste needs to be left on overnight making sleeping and eating inconvenient</li>\n<li>When the fading process starts it looks patchy and unappealing</li>\n<li>Certain professions for example catering and medical can be averse to having henna \"on show\"</li>\n<li>If you want to have the \"henna look\" that is removable in minutes - mehndi mica</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Henna and the West</h2>\n<p>In the 21st century henna has spread into the modern western culture. Henna artists can be found in all spheres of western life and they have introduced new \"body parts\" to be worked on!<br><br>Like the belly...back of the neck..top of the head...</p>\n<p>Henna is now prevalent at music festivals, hen parties, goddess parties or simply at a girly get together.</p>\n<h2>Black Henna Warning</h2>\n<p>Henna used in its natural form can ONLY GIVE orange, dark brown to burgandy colour tones. there is no such thing as BLACK HENNA. Black henna is not safe as it includes a chemical dye called phenylenediamine (PPD) to give a \"black\" stain and this causes allergic reactions from irritation to a burning sensation of the skin.</p>\n<p><br><strong>NEVER USE BLACK HENNA</strong></p>'),(9,'<h2></h2>\n<table border=\"0\" frame=\"above\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td>\n<h4>Scott\'s Sparkle on Burns Night Celebrations</h4>\n<p>See the Scottish \"Asian\" celebration on Burns Night...using traditional henna combined with <span>red and green glitter..</span></p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"/static/media/uploads/red%20burns%20night%20mehndi.jpg\" width=\"200\">      <img border=\"0\" height=\"253\" src=\"/static/media/uploads/green%20burns%20night%20mehndi.jpg\" width=\"150\"></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><span>Strozzi Jewellery</span></h2>\n<p>Strozzi Abecel, an unusually gifted designer whose work exudes beauty in simplicity borne out of a love of craft and a passion for creativity.

What size Pro Kit is suitable?</h2>\n<p>A. If you have no experience of doing small fund raising events or you are just wanting to trial out a glitter tattoo home business - go for the small kit and work your way up.  This will give you a good idea if this is for you.</p>\n<p>You can buy Small, Medium or Large kits from the Retail Shop however; we recommend if you’re buying the large kit that you register for our Wholesale Shop.

You might want to create a poster, have a cash float, do some marketing. Events like a school fair will likely provide table and chairs. Depending on where you go you may need to pay for your pitch.</p>\n<h2>Q. Do I need special training to use the Pro Kit?</h2>\n<p>A. You do not need any kind of formal training to do glitter tattoos.  Check out our <a href=\"/learn/tips-and-application/\" target=\"_blank\">Tips and Applications</a> and watch to learn how it’s done.</p>\n<h2>Q. Are there any other things I need to consider before I start my Glitter Tattoo business?</h2>\n<p>A1. You will need to consider getting professional insurance which includes public liability cover of up to £5,000,000.  There are many insurance companies providing public liability.  The two that Manai or Manai Artists have used most are <a href=\"http://www.blackfriarsinsurance.co.uk/glitter-tattoo-insurance/\" target=\"_blank\">Blackfriars Group Insurance</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nmtf.co.uk/index.php?id_cpg=6\" target=\"_blank\">NMTF</a>.  If you are a professional in the beauty industry or an entertainer or facepainter you may be able to extend your insurance to cover glitter tattoos.  It is always worth making an enquiry.</p>\n<p>A2. You will need to consider cost -effective advertising/marketing solutions. Be sure to get on Facebook, Twitter and post an Ad to Gumtree advertising your services.</p>\n<p>A3. Here are some examples of how you could use your pro kit...</p>\n<p>Contact event planners or advertise your service to attend events in your local area.

What is special about Manai\'s products?</h2>\n<p>A1. Quality of Ingredients - All the products that Manai uses are the best available and they all comply with EU and USA health and safety regulations.  For example the glitter glue contains no latex and is used by the medical industry for prosthetic applications; the glitter is cosmetic grade (it is used by the cosmetic industry as an ingredient for eye makeup).  They all have Material Safety Data Sheets available upon request.</p>\n<p>A2.

Why does this Kit have potential to make such a good return?</h2>\n<p>A. A tattoo is a product that kids (and adults) really like.  For obvious reasons they cannot have a real one so what is the next best thing - one that is painless, has lots of colours to offer and is temporary so it can come off anytime.  The product fulfils all the criteria from the child and the parent\'s point of view.</p>\n<h2>Q. Why is £400 profit, a realistic figure?</h2>\n<p>A1. The kit has been tried and tested at various events from very large festivals - like the Womad and V or the Girl Guides Centenary celebrations where the footfall is over 20,000 to very small local events such as carnivals, schools fairs and fun days in the park where the footfall in a small school is around 150!  The price charged can be higher but at a school event it is £3.00 for a tattoo which is well within the \"pocket money\" capacity of most kids and it is \"value for money\" for parents and so these are the \"benchmark\" figure used in all calculations.</p>\n<p><strong>The income potential of a Large Pro Kit:</strong></p>\n<p>75 stencils @ £1 ... £75</p>\n<p>60 stencils @ £3.00 ... £180</p>\n<p>10 big stencils @ £8 ... £ 80</p>\n<p>100 medium stencils ... £300                                                                                                                   Purchase (£45) these in addition to stencils included in the pro kit.</p>\n<p>Total income is £635 and if you deduct the initial investment of £194 (pro kit £149 + extra stencils £45), the profit is  £431.</p>\n<p>A2. You have to bear in mind that you will be using this pro-kit over a number of events. On average you should be able to cover 3 school summer fayres and allowing for other costs, hire of a table (if applicable) at the fair, marketing costs etc.  (approx. £30) it is realistic to say that you can make a profit of £400 from the Large Pro Kit.</p>\n<h2>Q. What are the advantages of becoming a \"Manai Trader\" as oppose to any other glitter trader?</h2>\n<p>A1. After you place your first order we will email you to invite you to submit your details to our Manai Glitter Tattoo Artist Directory.

Its design and form does not allow it to form and flow around each \"individual\" hand. Body Art Jewellery allows for this to happen. Stencils vary in design and size and it allows you to choose the style and size that fits the hand like a glove. For example in the bracelet below, the use of the flower stencil coming from round the wrist draws the eye to the ring, elongates the fingers and allows you to see the beauty of the whole hand.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" height=\"302\" src=\"/static/media/uploads/-AA%20Nail%20Salons/_DSC3627%20(ZF-8815-91564-1-016)_422x637.jpg\" width=\"200\">                    <img border=\"0\" height=\"376\" src=\"/static/media/uploads/FL015%20daisy%20vine.jpg\" width=\"170\"></p>\n<h3>Dot Extention</h3>\n<p>Extend designs freehand using a thin layer of glue creating squirls, dots or other shapes.  Let this go tacky before dusting over the glitter otherwise the glitter will smudge.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"/static/media/uploads/-AA%20Nail%20Salons/AWC%20084_600x399.jpg\" width=\"300\"> </p>\n<h2>Match Colours</h2>\n<p>Matching colours to nail polish or outfit will get a “coordinated” look.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" height=\"408\" src=\"/static/media/uploads/-AA%20Nail%20Salons/_DSC3629%20(ZF-8815-91564-1-017)_422x637.jpg\" width=\"270\"></p>\n<h2>Necklace Stencils</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When applying the necklace cut off an excess stencil material if required.</li>\n<li>Place a normal necklace around the neck and find the centre  where the pendant sits and mark this with a pen.  Using this as a guide, take off the white card and aline the stencil so it sits centrally on the neck.  Check the alignment and adjust if necessary.  Once you are happy with this, apply the glue and glitter as per above</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img border=\"0\" height=\"309\" src=\"/static/media/uploads/rsz__dsc3678-edit_zf-8043-38557-1-001.jpg\" width=\"218\"></p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>Facts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Glitter can be used for body decorations, nail effects and even  as fairy dust.</li>\n<li>Glitter is manmade from polyester which has been cut extra fine to make into powders and must be body grade quality.</li>\n<li>Glitter glue is needed to apply the glitter.  The glue must be body grade quality. The best glue is one which contains no latex and is non toxic.  This glue is similiar to that used in plasters!</li>\n<li>Glitter patterns can be made by using one stencil or a combination of stencils.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Good Tips</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Stencils with small pieces, use the \"pick stick\" to remove them.</li>\n<li>Glitter stencils are not re-usable over and over again.  So the basic rule is one stencil for one client.</li>\n<li>Glitter designs are waterproof once dry so can last for 5+ days even after showering. Always be aware that if you have extended designs and used intricate stencils than it will last 3+ days. Applying the common sense test, if you have a bracelet design running along the finger and round the wrist and one on your lower back, the lower back is going to last much longer - it does not do a lot of washing up!</li>\n<li>Glitter designs can be taken off anytime with a babywipe, olive oil, or a good scrub with soap and water.  For INSTANT REMOVAL USE <a href=\"/retail-shop/applicators-removers/\">MYWIPE</a> tattoo remover.                              </li>\n<li>All the basics rules for the good health and safety of you and client apply. To recall a few of these - it must not be applied on anyone with sensitive, broken or skin that is sun burnt! DO A 24 HOUR PATCH TEST if required.</li>\n<li>It is silly to say that body art cannot be done on the face but good sense tells you to be extraordinarily careful around the eye area - DO NOT APPLY GLUE CLOSE TO THE EYE AREA.</li>\n<li>Clean brushes - use warm soapy water and leave to dry, use babay wipes or makeup remover wipes or the MYWIPE Tattoo Remover.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Ingredients</h2>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Cosmetic Grade Glitter - precision cut particles (hexagonal particles), Acrylates Copolymer, aluminium, approved pigments and food grade dye</li>\n<li>Glitter Glue- aqueous adhesive - does not contain latex</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the products conform with EC health and safety directive 2001/95/EC and have Material Safety Data Sheet available on request.</p>\n<p>Glitter Glue is also registered with the FDA (USA Food and Drug Agency).</p>\n</div>'),(251,'<p><img border=\"0\" height=\"260\" src=\"/static/media/uploads/September%202010%20cropped.jpg\" width=\"173\">Henna has been practiced in my family for many generations. I acquired my knowledge of henna, its history, culture, stories around particular intricate designs from my grandmother and mother. I have “doodled” henna since the age of 5 and I am now 50 so you can do the maths!</p>\n<p>Over the last 3 years, I have studied the work of henna artists like Catherine Cartwright Jones, Riffat, Mark Foster and Jen Schafer, all highly respected and influential artists in the Henna world. In the summer of 2008, I was privileged to meet Riffat and receive training from her.</p>\n<p>There is a wealth of information now available on the internet. Just google “henna”. As at October December 2011 I came up with 5,970,000 hits in 0.06 seconds!</p>\n<p>I make my own henna with all ingredients listed. All my henna and glitter products are sourced from people following fair trade principles and a great deal of research such as the geographical location of the original henna plant material, quality of the essential oils.</p>\n<p>In 2008 the birth of glitters, glue and stencils took on a new phase - many people are put off having henna because of its long staying power and it is very expensive to have a professional henna artist so I started researching the possibilities of having a \"henna like\" product which mimicked the colour and feel of henna but which could come off any time. Also is it possible to produce fantastic designs in a riot of colours like a henna pro? And so was born glitters, glue, stencils and the henna mimick henna  mica... The new products were launched in November 2010 at the Asian Wedding Exhibition where it was brilliantly received!!! I am now waiting to say \"the rest is history...\"</p>\n<p>I am a member of the Federation of Small Businesses and I have full public liability insurance cover.<br> <br>I live and work on the Isle of Man do my \"artwork\" for individual private clients and upon request unusual, off the beaten track “grown up” dinner/supper parties and children’s parties! By way of example, my most unusual request has been to do a “Sahara Nights” supper party where I did the henna work, decking out the venue and the catering with help from my friends!</p>\n<p>I hope that you enjoy this website and if there is anything you need that you won\'t hesitate to <a href=\"/contact/\">get in touch</a>!</p>\n<p>Meena Sidpra</p>');
